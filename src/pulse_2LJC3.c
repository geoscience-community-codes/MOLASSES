/*************************************
Module: PULSE
If volume remains to be erupted, deliver a pre-defined pulse of magma to 
vent cell and subtract this pulse from the vent cell's volume. Return the
total remaining volume through a pointer to the volumeRemaining variable.

INPUTS:
ActiveList *actList
Lava_flow *active_flow
DataCell **grid
double *volumeRemaining
double *gridinfo

Algorithm:
	  If more lava remains to be erupted:
	    Calculate thickness to deliver to vent
	    Add thickness to vent cell, subtract volume from remaining volume in cell
	    Calculate total volume remaining, exit
	  If no lava remains to be erupted:
	    Exit without doing anything
	
gridinfo elements used in this module:
[1] w-e pixel resolution
[5] n-s pixel resolution (negative value)

Calculate thickness of lava to deliver 
based on pulse volume and grid resolution
