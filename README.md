#### NAME
**MOLASSES**

MOLASSES stands for *MO*dular *LA*va *S*imulation *S*oftware for *E*arth *S*cience.
 
#### DESCRIPTION

MOLASSES is an in-progress fluid flow simulator, written in C. 
The MOLASSES model relies on a cellular automata algorithm to
estimate the area inundated by lava flows.

#### CODE REQUIREMENTS

1) MOLASSES requires the GDAL C libraries and a C compiler. GDAL libraries and development files are available for many systems (http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries); install both the gdal library and the header (development) files. We have tested this program on computers that use the C compiler gcc.

2) MOLASSES requires the memory management software GC (http://www.hboehm.info/gc/). Install both library (lib) and header files (dev). See the [readme](/external_files/readme/) file in the external_files directory for additional info.

3) MOLASSES requires RNGLIB, a C library which implements random number generators (https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/rnglib/rnglib.html). Also, See the [readme](/external_files/readme/) file in the external_files directory for additional info.

2) MOLASSES requires a DEM (Digital Elevation Model) in a format recognized by the GDAL code library. The DEM should extend beyond the boundaries of the lava flow(s). 

3) MOLASSES requires a configuration file that is specified on the command line when executing the code.

#### COMPILING and INSTALING THE CODE

Before compilation of MOLASSES modify the makefile in the top-level directory for your use. 

1) Check to make sure that the path to GDAL and gcc are properly set. 

2) The module names at the top of the Makefile may be changed to accomadate alternative model algorithms. This name refers to a new C-code file (for the alternative algorithm) in the src directory.

To compile and install MOLASSES execute the following commands:

		make
		make install

'make' compiles the code; 'make install' copies the code to a 'bin' directory specified in the top-level makefile.

#### PROGRAM EXECUTION

To run molasses type:

	$molasses $config_file

where $molasses indicates the exact name of the compiled code, and $config_file indicates the name of the configuration file. It is most convenient if the configuration file resides in your working directory.
